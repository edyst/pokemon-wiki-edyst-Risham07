            The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and were
            created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket Monsters Red and
            Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version was released sometime
            after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international release. The original
            Green version was not released outside Japan
